FIX 1: ParticleEmitter.m
    Moved the calculation that updates the particles timeToLive from inside the if statement to above the if statement. Fix provided by Riq (cocos2d)

    Make sure the the imageFileName is never empty as this causes the submitted particles to not work when being loaded and viewed
